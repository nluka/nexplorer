The <u>sw</u>iss <u>a</u>rmy k<u>n</u>ife program for Windows. One program to replace many, featuring:

- [ ] Powerful file explorer (wayyy better than Windows Explorer)
- [ ] Super fast file finder (Windows Explorer? pfff)
- [ ] yt-dlp frontend
- [ ] Fast, useful terminal (unlike Command Prompt)

## What annoys me about Windows Explorer

- Only a single pane
- Bad Shift-click behavior
- Search is wayyy too slow (it's useless)
- No batch renaming
- Lacks ability to see/kill processes which are locking a file
- Can't tell if a folder has stuff inside (files? folders? nested folders?)
