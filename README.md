Swan is a substitute to the Windows File Explorer (WFE hereafter) for those craving a more elegant file management experience. Many features are ported from WFE to make Swan a familiar experience, whilst solving several major frustrations:

- Ergonomic file operations through multiple explorer panes, instead of managing multiple WFE windows
- Instant and intuitive searching, instead of the slow and clumsy WFE search
- Bulk renaming, completely absent from the WFE

In addition, Swan solves many smaller frustrations, as identified in the [feature comparison section](#feature-comparison).

Due to feature immaturity, Swan is not intended to outright replace the WFE as of now. Rather, it's meant to be used as a powerful primary whilst making WFE an easy to reach secondary for when a feature is missing.
